# Summary

These are the parts used in the following video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e58yMo2MXdY

The parts were originally designed to be laser cut from 3mm acrylic rather than 3D printed, so the horn and hinge come in two versions. There are separate pieces which can be glued together, or there are single pieces which are already assembled.

Please note: This design is UNTESTED. It has only ever existed in CAD.
